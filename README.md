# amfs - Automated Musical Fountain Simulator
This project concerns the implementation of an Automated Musical Fountain Simulator (AMFS). The aim is to create a simulator in a game engine that will combine the
elements of water, light and music, to produce a synchronised performance given a random musical piece. Analysis of the piece happens prior to the performance, during
which we extract a selection of features that are deemed helpful to the performance, using known music information retrieval methods.
